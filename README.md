# E-Commerce

This application consists of the following microservices:

### API Gateway:

- Serves as the entry point for all requests.
- Manages authentication, rate-limiting, and token transformation.

### Auth Service:

- Handles user registration, login, and token validation.

### Order Service:

- Manages order processing.

### Product Service:

- Manages product information, utilizing optimistic locking for updates.

### Commons:

- Contains common files shared across other services.

## How To Build:

Use `.\gradlew clean build` to build the project.

## Dockerize Application

use `docker-compose up` to dockerize whole application, you can also use `.\run.sh` to build and dockerize.

## Running Locally

- Run each service individually or use `docker-compose up` to start all services.

## Creating a Cluster:

- The Terraform `main.tf` script can be used to apply network changes using below cmds-

```
terraform init
terrform plan
terraform apply
```

## CI/CD:

- The `build_and_deploy.yml` file is available for building and deploying services to Google Cloud Run.

## Using Atlantis for Network Changes:

- Use Atlantis to modify minimum or maximum instances or other network attributes, preferably after a PR is approved.
    - Run `atlantis plan` to review the changes. If they look good, apply them with `atlantis apply`.
    - If the changes are not acceptable, release the lock using `atlantis unlock`.

## H2 Console

I am using an H2 in-memory database in this project. 
Please note that data will be flushed upon restart. 
However, I have included a `data.sql` file to populate initial data, which can be modified as needed.
All URLs must go through the API Gateway, which is running on port 8080.

The H2 console is excluded from security and can be accessed using the following URLs:

```
http://localhost:8080/auth/h2-console
http://localhost:8080/order/h2-console
http://localhost:8080/product/h2-console
```

## Swagger- Api Documentation

Similarly, Swagger is also excluded from security and can be accessed using the following URLs:

```
http://localhost:8080/auth/swagger-ui/index.html
http://localhost:8080/order/swagger-ui/index.html
http://localhost:8080/product/swagger-ui/index.html
```

## Postman Collection

Postman collections for APIs and the environment are available in the postman folder for quick testing. 
I have tested all APIs locally and with Docker, and they are working as expected. (âœ…)
